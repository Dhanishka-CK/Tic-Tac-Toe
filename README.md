This project implements a simple AI-based interactive Tic Tac Toe game simulation using Pygame. The agent navigates the maze, collects food pellets, and avoids obstacles based on a knowledge-based or search algorithm approach from the AIMA (Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach) framework.

Tech Stack: Python, Pygame, AIMA library

Key Concepts: Game simulation, AI agent behavior, environment visualization
